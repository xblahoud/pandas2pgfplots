# pandas2pgfplots

Pandas2pgfplots supports plotting of data stored in [pandas] DataFrame objects
using [pgfplots] that is based on the amazing [TikZ and PGF] packages. The code
generated by this package can be easily included in LaTeX documents. In Jupyter
notebooks, the plots are rendered using [itikz] (requires working LaTeX
distribution in `$PATH`).

Currently, the package only supports two kinds of plots:
 * scatter plots
 * cactus plots

## Installation

### Requirements
 * [pandas]>=1.0
 * [itikz]>=0.1.5
 * working LaTeX distribution

The Python requirements and pandas2pgfplots itself can be installed from [PyPI]
using pip by
```shell
python3 -m pip install -U pandas2pgfplots
```
